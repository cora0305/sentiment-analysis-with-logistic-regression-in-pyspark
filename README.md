Training and processing in the spark data frame to save time and memory.

Sentiment analysis plays an important role in data science, it helps people to learn the data more efficiently and accurately. By exploring the data between the different kinds of people in the daily life, using the tools, techniques and algorithms to learn the core of data and predict the information. Sentiment analysis focus on the text which has some special or symbolic words to show the mood or attitude. Ming the text and using the machine learning techniques to train the model to get the results. Due to the fact that the size of the data in the sentiment analysis is always very large. By using pyspark to deal with the data, it could make the process of the data analysis more efficient and faster. Implementing the good performance data analysis process which could calculate easier than before. Moreover, there are many choices for the model training, logistic regression is a useful model which could be trained fast and performed well.
